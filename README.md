# Clinical-Patients-Outcome-Prediction-SUPPORT-II-
This project analyzes the SUPPORT II clinical trial dataset to predict treatment outcomes and survival probabilities for seriously ill hospitalized patients, helping healthcare providers make informed decisions about end-of-life care and resource allocation strategies. 

The objective of this report is to understand the treatment outcomes and prognosis of seriously ill
hospitalized patients. This research improves decision-making ability in patients at the end of life
when they have little control over their physical and mental state, thereby reducing chronic pain
and a prolonged dying process. Support II, the study includes an intervention that provided the
doctors or physicians with accurate predictive results on patients’ survival chances at two months
and six months.

**Definition**
In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of support II, the main objective is to use patient
demographic data to predict the outcome of prognosis at the end-of-life care. I have engineered
four different models to check for the best suited model and predict the outcome. Target variable
in this dataset falls into categorical data hence Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVM and
Random Forest models were used. 

**Data Collection**
The Exploratory Data Analysis was engineered in an open-source integrated development
environment (IDE), JupyterLab within the code was written in Jupyter Notebook.
The dataset has been extracted and imported from the ucimlrepo package using pip3 command
with dataset of id = 880. The dataset contains 9105 instances with 47 variables.
